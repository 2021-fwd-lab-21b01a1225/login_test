# Intervue.io Automation Script

This project is a simple automation script built with Python and Selenium. It simulates a real user visiting Intervue.io, logging in as a company user, performing a search, and logging out ‚Äî all through a Chrome browser.

## What This Script Does:

1. Opens the Intervue.io homepage  
2. Clicks the Login button and switches to the login tab  
3. And click on the login for companies  
4. Logs in using company credentials (email & password)  
5. Searches for the word "hello" on the dashboard  
6. Clicks on a user profile from the results  
7. Logs out of the application

## Highlights

Here‚Äôs what makes the script work smoothly:
1.Uses both time.sleep() and WebDriverWait to handle page loads and dynamic content
2.Manages multiple tabs by switching between browser windows
3.Scrolls to elements and waits for them to be clickable before clicking
4.Logs out and closes the browser safely
